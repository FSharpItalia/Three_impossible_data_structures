# Three impossible data structures

---

Data structures are very important in Computer Science as well in many people professional carriers. So it might be strange to think of some data structures that are completely useless and will never be deployed anywhere at any time. But, the very exercise in itself, it's a good way to look not only at the other side of the coin but also to the other-other side.
The first data structure has to deal with the uncertainty principle of Heisenberg and the very fact that measure can influence the phenomenon we're inquiring and it can give us just one part of the picture while we're not sure about the other.
